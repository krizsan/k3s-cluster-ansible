# Installs K3S on a master node with the supplied IP address.
# Stores the IP address and the access token of the K3S master node in dedicated files
# as to make them available when installing K3S agent(s) on other host(s).
#
# Parameters:
# vm_ip - IP address of Multipass VM on which to install the K3S master.
# vm_user - User in the Multipass VM used to SSH to the VM with.
# vm_user_ssh_private_key_file - File containing above user's private key used to SSH to the VM with.
# Output:
# k3s_master_token - Token to be used when installing K3S agents to be managed by master.
# k3s_master_ip - IP address of K3S master node.
- name: Delete any existing file containing K3S master node IP address.
